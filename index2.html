			Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web
			designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have
			scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins
			with:
		</p>

		<h2><a href="detail-view-2.html">Quote</a></h2>
		<p class="block2" id="toggle" onclick="colorchange()" id="toggle" onclick="colorchange()">"Lorem ipsum dolor
			sit amet,

		<p id="block1">The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their
			dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software.
			Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your

		<p id="block1">In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections
			1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:
			<br>
			“Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non
			numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.”</p>

		<p id="block1">McClintock's eye for detail certainly helped narrow the whereabouts of lorem ipsum's origin,
			however, the “how and when” still remain something of a mystery, with competing theories and timelines.</p>
